@article{hernandez-aguero_effects_2020,
	abstract = {Prey detection and selection by birds can be influenced by prey coloration. Whereas certain colours can indicate to predators the unpalatability of prey (i.e. aposematism), other colours can render prey cryptic against the background. However, there are discrepancies in the response of birds to prey coloration reported in different studies. Such discrepancies can be the result of geographical or temporal (e.g. seasonal) differences between studies if birds in different regions respond differently to coloration or if responses vary seasonally due to changes in bird composition. Experimental studies aiming to understand bird responses to prey colour should consider the effect of geographical variation while accounting for seasonal as well as interannual variability. We investigated the effects of colour on attack rates by exposing plasticine caterpillars of different colours to bird communities in 13 Mediterranean forests in central Spain for a period from 17 weeks to 7 months. Overall, yellow and green dummy caterpillars suffered the lowest attack rates. We also observed a bimodal pattern of bird attack rates through time, with highest predation occurring in late winter and summer (June to September). Low attack rates on yellow dummies are probably a consequence of aposematism, while low attack rates on green dummies probably resulted from crypsis. Rapid decreases in attack rates over time are probably a result of avoidance learning, whereas the increase in attacks in summer could be explained by the increase in fledglings and migrant birds.},

@article{seifert_predation_2015,
	abstract = {Abstract:
            Predation pressure is essential in regulating population dynamics of herbivorous insects. We used artificial caterpillars (25 × 4 mm) made from brown-or green-coloured plasticine to compare predation pressure between countryside and near-natural rain-forest habitat in the Gulfo Dulce region (Costa Rica). Within each habitat, 162 caterpillars were placed randomly on different substrates along a 1200-m transect and at heights between 0.5 and 2.0 m. Artificial caterpillars were inspected at 24-h intervals for 3 consecutive days. Predation pressure was almost twice as high for countryside (mean attack frequency per capita: 1.11 $\pm$ 0.08 SE) compared with rain forest (0.66 $\pm$ 0.07 SE). In both habitats arthropods emerged as chief predator group, followed by birds. Attacks by non-volant mammals were very rare and restricted to rain-forest sites. In the countryside, bird attacks were more than four times as common as in forest, indicating a change in their relative importance across habitats.},

Naive snails moved in different directions and did not locate either food above chance, although both foods were readily eaten upon direct contact. After a single carrot feeding episode, 75\% of the carrot-fed snails moved directly towards the carrot and ate it. Conversely, potato-fed snails located the potato in 67\% of the cases. Snails that were fed apple or lettuce behaved like naive animals, with the majority of animals (75\% in both cases) locating neither the carrot nor the potato.},
